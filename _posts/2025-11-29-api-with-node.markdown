**What have I learned about APIs with Node.js?**

I’ve learned that building APIs with Node.js is all about understanding how data flows between a client and a server. By working with Express, routing started to make sense. Each endpoint has a purpose, and the server responds based on the incoming request. I began to understand how middleware works behind the scenes, how to structure my routes, and how to return clean, meaningful JSON responses. More importantly, I realized how Node’s asynchronous nature makes it ideal for handling multiple requests efficiently without blocking the server.

I also learned the value of organizing an API so it’s easy to maintain and scale. Concepts like separating controllers from routes, using environment variables, and handling errors properly helped me think beyond just “making it work.” I became more comfortable reading and creating documentation, testing endpoints with tools like Postman, and understanding what makes an API secure and reliable. Overall, working with Node.js gave me a clearer picture of how modern backend systems communicate and how I can build them with confidence.
