After watching Lex Fridman’s long-form interview with Brendan Eich, I walked away with a much deeper appreciation for how unpredictable the evolution of the web truly is. Eich’s recounting of the early days of JavaScript didn’t feel like a neat success story. Instead, it sounded like a whirlwind of deadlines, compromises, and rapid decisions that still influence developers today. Hearing him explain how the language came together in such a short time made me rethink how much of the web’s foundation was built through experimentation rather than strict planning. What surprised me most was how intentionally imperfect some early choices were, simply because browsers needed a scripting language immediately. The fact that this rushed beginning eventually became the backbone of front-end development is both humbling and motivating. It reminded me that impactful technology doesn’t always start polished; sometimes it just needs to solve a problem well enough to earn its place.

The interview also shifted the way I think about where the web is heading. Eich’s thoughts on decentralization, user-controlled identity, and evolving business models showed how much potential still exists in the browser environment. Even though I’m not fully sold on every Web3 concept, I found his perspective valuable because it framed future web APIs as tools that could empower users rather than just developers. Instead of viewing my daily work as wiring together components and endpoints, the conversation made me consider the larger ecosystem each of us contributes to. The web is a constant negotiation between innovation, legacy decisions, and user needs, and Eich’s stories made that tension feel more alive. Overall, the interview left me more curious about the design choices behind the tools I use. And, even more excited to keep building in a way that respects both the history and the future of the platform.
