**What have I learned about git and GitHub?**

When it comes to Git, I see it as an essential part of every project, no matter how small or simple it might be. It feels like a safety net that protects the work I’ve put hours into. Imagine working on a project for a full week and never adding it to a repository. Suddenly, a thunderstorm rolls in, lightning hits a power line, and your PC shuts off for good because you didn’t have a surge protector. To make things worse, your storage drive fails at the exact same time, wiping everything out. That’s exactly why Git matters to me, because one daily commit can save an entire week of work when things go wrong.

GitHub builds on top of Git by giving me an online visual platform to manage everything more easily. Instead of just tracking changes, GitHub lets me collaborate with others and keep everything organized in one place. It extends Git’s capabilities by adding tools like issue tracking, project boards, and code reviews. I also appreciate the added security features that help keep my repositories safe. The interface makes it simple to see my branches, commits, and pull requests without needing to dig through command-line output. Overall, GitHub gives me a clearer, more powerful way to manage my projects and work with others.
